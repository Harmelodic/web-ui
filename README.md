# @harmelodic/react-ui-lib

A library of React components for consistent composable UI development.

Mainly for use on my (Harmelodic) projects, but if you like my style/theming then... feel free to use it!

## Demo

To view a demo of this application:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Harmelodic/react-ui-lib.git
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Then open a browser to http://localhost:8080.

## Publishing npm package

```
$ npm version <major|minor|patch>
$ npm run build
$ npm publish
$ git push
```

# TODO

- Automating the publishing with GitHub Actions.
- Live docs on the web (probably https://harmelodic.github.io/react-ui-lib).
- Document design principles.
- Build more components for quicker UI development of new projects.
