# @harmelodic/web-ui

A library of React components for consistent composable UI development.

Mainly for use on my (Harmelodic) projects, but if you like my style/theming then... feel free to use it!

## Publishing npm package

```shell
npm ci 
npm version <major|minor|patch>
npm run build
npm publish
git push
```

# TODO

- Automating the publishing with GitHub Actions.
- Storybook integration?
